<h2>What is this:
<h4>Hello, here I will have some guides and resources.
<h4>I will, hopefully, teach you how to be safe and private online, as well as piracy and hosting.
<h4>There will be lots of links to good sources of information in places where i just cant explain better than them.
<h4>I will mostly recommend foss (free and open source software) as its usually where the safety and privacy is.
<h2>I hope you like this page :)

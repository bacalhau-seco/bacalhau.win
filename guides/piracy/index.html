<h2>Things to keep in mind:</h2>
<h4>Piracy is illegal in many countries and you might get in trouble depending on where you live.
<h4>This guide, will mostly be focused in how to safely start pirating digital media, and how to find the information needed for most things.
<h4>This guide is based on my own experience.
<h2>how to stay safe:
<h4>Online piracy is a great way to transmit virus and scam people that dont know what they are doing. This things are mostly spread arround by ads on piracy websites.
To keeps yourself safe from ads and fingerpriting i recomend you using either <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/download/thanks/">firefox</a> or <a href="https://librewolf.net/installation/">librewolf</a> with ublock origin installed. These things will instatly make you less vulnerable to getting hacked.
For torrenting, the only thing i can recomend is <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qbittorrent</a>
<h4>Keep in mind that this isnt going to make you hacker-proof, as there are there are lots of diferent ways you can be hacked, expecially if you dont know where too look things up.
<h2>The links:
<h4>There is only 1 place where you can find a link to almost anything you would want to pirate:
<a href="https://rentry.co/megathread">Megathread</a>
<h2>Specifics:
<h4>The Megathread doesnt have a link for everything, and because of this, i will do my best to post some more specific guides on how to pirate specific content.

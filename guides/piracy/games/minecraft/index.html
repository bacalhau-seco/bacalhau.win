<h2>Introduction:
<h4>This is a really simple guide on how to install and play cracked minecraft.
<h4>In my opinion at least, cracked minecraft is way better than nthe payed version, as you cant get false banned from the entire multiplayer and basically lose 30â‚¬, as multiplayer is the best part of the game.
<h4>With cracked minecraft you will be able to mod the game and allways get the latest updates, all for free, and using foss!
<h4>Keep in mind that on cracked minecraft you can only play on cracked servers like <a href="https://basedmc.club">Based MC</a> wich is a cracked anarchy server i host.

<h2>Free minecraft!!
<h4>Extract it to a folder and run the program.
<h4>After that just add an instance, and offline account and play
<h2>Multiplayer
<h3>If you join a cracked server that doesnt ask for registration or login, LEAVE, as it means anyone can just join with your name and you will lose all your progress!
<h4>Cracked servers are usually harder to find, my tip is to just ask people on social media.
<h4>Im hosting a cracked minecraft anarchy server called <a href="https://basedmc.club">Based MC</a>, please try it out.
